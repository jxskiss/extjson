extjson extends the JSON syntax with following features:

1. trailing comma of Object and Array
1. traditional, end of line, or pragma comments
1. simple identifier as object key without quotes
1. Python boolean constants
1. Python None as null
1. Python style single quote string
1. import other JSON files (with max depth limited)

It helps in many scenes, such as:

1. working with data generated by python programs
1. configuration with comments
1. managing many json files with duplicate contents
1. data driven testing by JSON files
